Hi Riley, my name is Stefanius and I recently came across your blog-post about farmers that get paid by people to help them on their farm. Your blog was very interesting and I can agree your assumption.

The first thing I want to mention is that working at a farm has a lot of benefits. People can learn how to handle other living beings and overall how farmers produce their products. For example milking a cow could be a very interesting experience. Moreover, at a farm you are basically urged to keep everything clean.

Additionally, to help at a farm has not only benefits for your side. You can help the farmer a lot with your work there, plus you will gain extraordinary experience too. It was especially delightful to hear that you get a free box full of vegetables that are fresher than in the supermarket.

Last but not least, you can protect your environment easily with that even more. There is for example fewer food waste and lesser work to do at the farm for each person.

Thank's again for your interesting blog-post. I'm looking forward to your next posts.
