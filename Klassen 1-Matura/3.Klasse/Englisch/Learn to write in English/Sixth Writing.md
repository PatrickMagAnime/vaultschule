**(Firstsly: from the visitors view, the benefits of sc are, near the town, less effort to transport sth)**

**(Moreover: concerns are, that a big centre in mid town is a bad idea, pro: shoping centre in near, con: prob overfilled)**

**(Lastly: it does not fit in, too big, too loud, too many people there, sound burden for ppl living there,)**
